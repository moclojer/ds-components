# mockingbird

Design System using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [helix](https://github.com/lilactown/helix) in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/).

A simple way to develop a user interface with a consistent user experience, without the need to clutter **cljs** code with **CSS** (unless you want to).

> Work In Progress: if your desire is to use mockingbird without ClojureScript (how dare you!) you can of course use our npm package into your JS application. Read more [here](#Installation).

## name reference?

> "mockingbird" is for everyone!

The name is a reference to the book [To Kill a Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird) by Harper Lee. The idea is that the design system is a "mockingbird" that sings the same song everywhere.

It's impossible to talk about *"mockingbird"* without remembering the song [Mockingbird by Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9bCLPwzSC0) with his daughter Hailie Jade. The song is a declaration of love from a father to his daughter.

**mockingbird** is a declaration of love for all developers ~~(frontend will never be easy for backend developers)~~.

# Overview

Mockingbird offers a set of reusable components and utilities that increases speed and beauty on your UI development. By integrating Tailwind, Helix and ReFx, Mockingbird combines functional programming and a powerful component model in order to create a fast and lightweight design system. This allows your team to focus on building robust, reactive interfaces without getting bogged down in styling and local state management concerns.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Clojure: Follow the [Clojure Installation guide](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) to set up your environment.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer/current).
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/downloads).

# Installation

We distribute our software via clojars (and intend to do so also by npm):

deps.edn:
``` clj
  moclojer/mockingbird {:mvn/version "0.0.1"}
```

You will also need to start a project with shadow-cljs and install the npm deps.

npm:

``` sh

$ npx create-cljs-project your-project
$ npm install react autoprefixer babel-loader css-loader cssnano karma karma-chrome-launcher karma-cljs-test msw npm-run-all postcss postcss-cli postcss-loade postcss-preset-env shadow-cljs tailwindcss webpack webpack-cli rimraf glob @isaacs/cliui --save-dev

```

Copy our [tailwind.config.js](tailwind.config.js), specially the colors, into your own config.

# Usage 

add a import on a specific component or layout component you want and load it in your screen

``` clj
(:require 
  [mockingbird.components.button :refer [button]]
  [helix.core :refer [$]])
;; use it then
  ($ button)

```

you can pass arguments into our components simply as this:


``` clj
  ($ button {:class "special-class-i-want-to-add"
             :theme :mockingbird
             :size :sm 
             :label "My-special-label"})

```
As you can see, our components have specific built-in styles for you. You can see a handful tutorial on the parameters for styling the components [here](docs/params.md)

# Testing Locally 

You can clone and build this repo, to see some examples of good usage of our dear Mockingbird. You can read more [here](docs/test.md).

- you will need to configure your shadow cljs environment too!

> for better understanding, follow the offcial [shadow-cljs guide](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
